Liberalism has evolved over time from ideas that would now be considered Republican into its modern form, but always existing as a left-wing ideology.\n\nLiberalism, unlike Republicanism, is not always, well, Republican. As one of the largest opposition parties in the British Empire and as the leading party in the Californian government, there are plenty of examples of Liberalism without Republicanism. However, many Liberals face stiff opposition in a primarily right-wing world, being denounced as Marxists and Republicans."

Being seen as one of the most modern democratic institutions, most Republicans support a parliamentary system within the government. That is, of course, without a House of Lords and a monarch, with another elected house and the aformentioned elected official serving in their place."
